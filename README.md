Here are all the task I did during my Internship

        Task 2:
MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON

Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on
features like genre, director, and actors. You can use regression
techniques to tackle this problem.
The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model
that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or
critics.
Movie Rating Prediction project enables you to explore data
analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine
learning modeling techniques. It provides insights into the factors
that influence movie ratings and allows you to build a model that
can estimate the ratings of movies accurately.

        Task 3:
IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor,
and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their
measurements. Now, imagine that you have the measurements
of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. Your
objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from
these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into
their respective species.
Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris
flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal
measurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory
classification tasks.    

       Task 5 :
CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card
transactions.
Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class
imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random
forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall,
and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or
undersampling for improving results.
